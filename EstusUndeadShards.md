#### Estus Shard Locations

1. **High Wall of Lothric** - On an anvil in the room where you get the Cell Key
2. **Undead Settlement** - By the burning tree with worshipping undead. This is to the left of the Undead Settlement bonfire, past the house
3. **Road of Sacrifices** - From the Crucifixion Woods bonfire head towards the Crystal Sage. Pass under the small bridge. The shard will be on the left side of the ruins near a fire that has two Lycanthrope.
4. **Farron Keep** - Go straight out from the starting bonfire. The shard is near a fallen tower guarded by slugs.
5. **Cathedral of the Deep** - Right outside the *Cleansing Chapel bonfire* where enemies are praying
6. **Firelink Shrine** - Purchase the Tower Key and get to the bridge that overlooks the Shrine. Drop down and find a window that allows you to get inside and get the shard on the rafters. (Alternatively go upstairs and outside and find the tree near the raised area with loot on it, then run up the tree and jump onto the raised area - no key needed!)
7. **Smouldering Lake** - On a body near a hole from the *Old King's Antechamber bonfire*. Look for an illusionary wall in the bonfire room.
8. **Irithyll Dungeon** - From the bonfire, walk forward into the dungeon and turn right. Now go straight, head through the locked gate, and then drop down. Go right into the room and there should be a chest which is a mimic that contains the shard.
9. **Anor Londo** - In a chest on the first floor of the large dark room with the Deacons (before the Aldrich fog wall). Enter from the double doors and hug the left wall to find it.
10. **High Wall of Lothric/Consumed King's Garden** - From *Dancer of the Boreal Valley bonfire*, climb up ladder and go first left. Use the elevator and jump out halfway. Estus Shard is down the stairs to the right.
11. **Grand Archives** - On the top of Lothric Castle looking towards the Twin Princes fight. It is at the very back of the roof near the Hunter's Ring and the golden winged enemies.

#### Undead Shards

1. **Undead Settlement** - Start near the *Dilapidated Bridge bonfire* near the white birch tree where the arrows fall if you haven't killed or befriended the giant, to the right of this tree is a platform you can jump to with the Undead Bone Shard on a dead body.
2. **Cathedral of the Deep** - Also near a white birch tree that the Giant shoots arrows around,  on the roof area of the Cathedral after navigating the graveyard and crossing a bridge
3. **Farron Keep** - On the bottom of the tower to the right of the door with the three flames that you have to light. It is surrounded by a bunch of slugs
4. **Catacombs of Carthus** - Kill a skeleton with a hat on at the bottom of the long stairs near the first Skeleton Ball, the ball will blow up and reveal a shard
5. **Smouldering Lake** - Kill the worm
6. **Smouldering Lake** - In the room with the demon statues, just before the *Demon Ruins bonfire*. Guarded by a lava blob that drops on top of you when you go to pick it up
7. **Irithyll of the Boreal Valley** - Starting at the *Church of Yorshka bonfire*, go down the hallway stairs, and go right along the cliff. The Undead Bone shard is located behind the large tombstone at the end of this path
8. **Profaned Capital** - After you fight the first Gargoyle of the area, it will be on a corpse nearby
9. **Lothric Castle** - Starting at the *Dragon Barracks bonfire*, go up the stairs and to the bridge where the two dragons are. Run almost all the way across the bridge and drop off at the end. Undead Bone Shard is underneath the bridge
10. **Grand Archives** - In the area of the rooftops where you fight some Gargoyles, there will be a broken window that you can enter. The shard will be in this room.
