2. **Sage’s Coal**: *Road of Sacrifices* - Teleport to the Farron Keep bonfire, go into the swamp and head left, following the wall. You’ll see a tower at a certain point, guarded by a single Darkwraith. Defeat him and enter the tower. The coal will be on a corpse inside.
3. **Giant's Coal**: *Anor Londo* -  Spawn at the Anor Londo bonfire and go up the stairs. Turn left when you get to the top (watch out for the Silver Knights) and enter the tower. You’ll see a dead giant on the tower floor, holding the coal in his hands.

#### Umbral Ashes

1. **Mortician’s Ashes**: *Undead Settlement* -  Spawn at the Dilapidated Bridge bonfire and go straight to the area where the giant throws his spears. The ashes are on a body by the tree to the left of the gate, near the wooden shack.

3. **Paladin’s Ashes**: *Cathedral of The Deep* - When you go down the giant steps that lead to the first bonfire in the Cathedral of The Deep area, turn right just before you reach it. Go down the narrow path and after a few steps, you’ll see a corpse with the ashes.
4. **Easterner’s Ashes Location**: *Irithyl of the Boreal Valley* -  After you kill Pontiff Sulyvahn, go across the courtyard and up the stairs. Go to the rightmost arch and climb along it all the way up. When you’re near the end, jump off onto the ledge below. You’ll find the ashes on a corpse there. Be wary of Silver Knights sniping from above.
5. **Excrement-covered Ashes**: *Irithyll of The Boreal Valley* - When you get down to the river in Irithyll, look for a low-hanging arch that leads into the sewer. Once you’re in, look for torches on the walls. You’ll see a staircase leading up, and the ashes will be opposite the stairs, on a corpse in the water.
6. **Hollow's Ashes**: *Untended Graves* - Once you beat the boss and enter Dark Firelink Shrine, go to the place where Yoel of Londor sits in the regular shrine (to the left of the anvil, down the stairs and in the far corridor). The ashes are on a corpse.
7. **Prisoner Chief Ashes**: *Irithyll Dungeon* - Get Jailer’s Key Ring. teleport to the Irithyll Dungeon bonfire, go into the large prison room and jump down one floor. Go all the way to the right – the last cell you’ll see will have two doors and a fancy chair inside. The ashes are on the corpse on that chair.
8. **Dragon Chaser's Ashes**: *Archdragon Peak* - where you fight Nameless King, on the path to where you get the twinkling dragon body stone. To the left of an archway, on a corpse being guarded by a Rock Lizard.
